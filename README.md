# Chronica
#### Video-demo:
#### Description:
Chronica is designed with two key purposes in mind:

1. A Simple Journaling App – A personal space for daily reflections, thoughts, and experiences.
2. A Shared Memory Capsule – A way to record and share past memories with friends on the app, preserving stories for future generations.

The inspiration behind this app comes from a personal place. My grandfather passed away before I was born, leaving no written record of his life. This absence made me realize the value of keeping a diary—not just for myself, but as a time capsule for those who come after me.

This app was developed for the final project of Harvard's online CS50x course, using Ruby on Rails template generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
